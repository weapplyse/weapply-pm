# Linear Integration

## Issue Creation

Only create issues when explicitly requested.

```json
{
  "team": "WeTest",
  "project": "Linear Automation",
  "assignee": "pelle@weapply.se",
  "labels": ["<Type>", "<Tech>", "<Dept (if applicable)>"]
}
```

## Type Labels
- `Bug` - Something broken
- `Feature` - New functionality  
- `Task` - General work
- `Improvement` - Enhancement

## Label Guidance

- Use one Type label and one Tech label when applicable.
- Add a Dept label only when ownership is clear.
- Do not add Request Source or Client labels manually (auto-set by webhook).

## After Work Complete

1. Mark issue as "Done" if applicable
2. Only commit changes when the user explicitly asks
