Hi Team,

I'm experiencing an issue with the login functionality. When I try to log in with my credentials, I get an error message saying "Invalid credentials" even though I'm sure my password is correct.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to the login page
2. Enter email: john.doe@example.com
3. Enter password: mypassword123
4. Click "Login"
5. See error message

This is blocking me from accessing my account. Could you please look into this urgently?

Thanks,
John Doe
