# Recommendation: Best Way Forward

## ✅ **RECOMMENDED: Use Our Tool with Auto-Creation**

### Why This Approach is Best:

1. **AI-Powered Refinement** 🤖
   - Emails are intelligently structured into well-formatted Linear tickets
   - Extracts action items, summaries, and key information
   - Suggests priority, labels, and assignees

2. **Fully Automated** ⚡
   - Emails to `pm@weapply.se` → Automatic Linear ticket creation
   - No manual steps required
   - Works 24/7

3. **Better Than Linear's Built-in Email** 📈
   - Linear's email integration is basic (no AI refinement)
   - Our tool provides structured, actionable tickets
   - Full control over formatting and metadata

4. **Flexible & Customizable** 🛠️
   - Easy to adjust team/project mapping
   - Customizable AI prompts
   - Can disable auto-creation if needed

### Setup Steps:

1. **Deploy the service** (Vercel/Railway/Netlify - ~5 min)
2. **Configure email forwarding** from `pm@weapply.se` to webhook URL
3. **Done!** Emails automatically become Linear tickets

See `SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED: Linear's Built-in Email Only**

### Why Not:

- ❌ No AI refinement - tickets are just raw email content
- ❌ Limited formatting options
- ❌ Less control over ticket structure
- ❌ No automatic extraction of action items or summaries

### When to Use:

Only if you want the absolute simplest setup and don't need AI refinement.
